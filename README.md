# **Student Project: Task Solver**

This repository contains the solution to a set of programming tasks that involve processing and managing various datasets using **generic classes** and a **singly linked list** data structure. The program is designed to handle a variety of real-world scenarios, such as managing information for teachers, students, bus routes, publications, and more.

## **Project Overview**

The primary objective of this project is to implement a program that can:
- Read data from text files containing details about teachers, students, buses, publications, etc.
- Use **singly linked lists** to store and manipulate the data.
- Implement the **`Iterable<E>`** interface to allow for easy traversal of datasets.
- Process the data, sort it based on specific criteria, and perform various calculations as required by the task descriptions.
- Output the results in a structured format to the console and save them into text files.

### **Core Features**
1. **Data Handling**: 
   - Reads input data from text files.
   - Stores data in singly linked lists for efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal.
   
2. **Generic Classes**: 
   - Implements generic classes to manage different data types across tasks.
   
3. **Iterable Interface**: 
   - Datasets are made iterable to easily traverse and process data.
   
4. **Sorting and Filtering**: 
   - Sorts and filters data based on the criteria specified in each task (e.g., alphabetical order, numerical values).

5. **File Output**: 
   - Outputs processed results both in the console and into text files for later use or review.

### **Tasks Solved**
The program addresses several tasks that involve real-world scenarios, including:
- Managing teacher-student relationships and their modules.
- Analyzing bus routes and ticket prices.
- Calculating publication revenues and managing subscriptions.
- Distributing bonuses to employees based on their contributions.
- Sorting and analyzing basketball player statistics.
- Calculating utility bills for residents, among other tasks.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Java** (or relevant language depending on your implementation).
- **Singly Linked List** data structure.
- **Generics** for flexible data handling.
- **Iterable interface** for iteration over data sets.

### **How to Use**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Run the program. It will automatically read from the provided text files (you may need to adjust file paths).
4. Follow on-screen instructions or provide input as requested (for example, typing a lecturer's name, a city, or a publication title).
5. The results will be displayed in the console and saved in text files.
